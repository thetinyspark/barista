# Exercices 

## Exercice 1: Draw a Kirby with canvas API

This exercise is quite simple, you just have to draw a Kirby by using canvas API calls. 
Specifically, the ones you've learn in episode 2 & 3 on the moocaccino youtube channel. 
For those who don't know, Kirby is a very cute pink alien designed by Nintendo, your result 
should look like this:

## Exercice 2: Draw a curve which represents variation throught time

This exercise is more about data visualization, you have to draw a curve 
which represents the following datas throught time: 
```typescript
const data = [
    {amount: 0, time: 0},
    {amount: 10, time: 5},
    {amount: 12, time: 10},
    {amount: 5, time: 15},
    {amount: 7, time: 20},
    {amount: 20, time: 25},
    {amount: 10, time: 30},
    {amount: 0, time: 35}
]; 
```

The result should look like this : 

![curve](./curve.png "Curve")
